## ðŸ“š Feijuca API Endpoints Documentation

This section aims to document all the endpoints available in the Feijuca project. Since Keycloak is highly extensible, we consume various endpoints from the tool to provide the needed functionality.

The official Feijuca documentation is quite limited, so having a Swagger definition with all the endpoints that ultimately perform actions in Keycloak is very helpful. This is the purpose of this section.

> **Note:** The endpoints listed here may be outdated, as new ones are occasionally created.  
> To get the most up-to-date definition, you can run the container locally on your machine or server.
