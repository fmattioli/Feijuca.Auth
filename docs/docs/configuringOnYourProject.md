### 📦 Step 1: Install the NuGet Package

Start by installing the **Feijuca.Auth** package from NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package Feijuca.Auth
```

You can also find it [on NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Feijuca.Auth).

This package contains all the necessary components to enable Keycloak-based authentication and authorization in your API.

### ⚙️ Step 2: Configure the `appsettings.json`

After installing the package, it's time to configure your `appsettings.json` file.  
You need to define an array of realms that your application will support.

> 💡 This allows **Feijuca.Auth** to support multi-tenant scenarios.  
> For now, we’ll configure a **single-tenant** example.

Here’s a minimal configuration example:

```json
"Realms": [
  {
    "Name": "smartconsig",
    "Issuer": "https://keycloak-instance-url/realms/your-created-realm"
  }
]
```

- **Name**: An internal identifier for your realm.
- **Issuer**: The full URL to your Keycloak realm’s issuer, typically `https://<host>/realms/<realm-name>`.

This section is required and will be passed to **Feijuca** when initializing the authentication layer.

---

### 🧩 Step 3: Register Feijuca in `Program.cs`

Now that your `appsettings.json` is configured, it's time to enable Feijuca in your application.

Inside your `Program.cs`, register the authentication services by calling the following extension method:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddApiAuthentication(applicationSettings.Realms);
```

This method will:

- Automatically register all necessary **JWT authentication** and **authorization** services.
- Load your configured realms and validate tokens issued by them when it arrives to your api.

> 💡 I recommend you create a class called Settings and map the appsettings.json on this class, you can merge your personal appsettings config and also add the Realm array that is required for Feijuca. For example:

```json
{
  "Settings": {
    "Realms": [
      {
        "Name": "smartconsig",
        "Issuer": "https://services-keycloak.ul0sru.easypanel.host/realms/smartconsig"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

```csharp
public class Settings
{
    public required IEnumerable<Realm> Realms { get; set; }
}
```

```csharp
var applicationSettings = builder.Configuration.GetSection("Settings").Get<Settings>();
```

### 🛡 Reviewing the Changes

With these simple changes, you'll be able to add a security layer to your API using **Feijuca.Auth**.  

For a practical example of how to configure it, check out this [sample Program.cs](https://github.com/fmattioli/Feijuca.Auth/blob/main/src/NuGet/Feijuca.Auth.Api.Tests/Program.cs) in the **Feijuca.Auth** repository on GitHub.

### 🔒 Next Steps: Protecting Your Endpoints

In the next step, we will dive deeper into securing your API endpoints.  
You will learn how to properly handle authentication and authorization by:

- Returning a **401 Unauthorized** response when the request contains an invalid or missing token, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected resources.
- Returning a **403 Forbidden** response when a user is authenticated but lacks the necessary permissions to access a particular endpoint, enforcing fine-grained access control.

Additionally, we'll explore best practices to implement these protections seamlessly in your .NET API using Feijuca.Auth, so you can provide a secure and robust experience for your users.

Let's go enhance your application's trustworthiness and with a easily way!
